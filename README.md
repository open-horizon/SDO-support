# Open Horizon SDO Support

Edge devices built with [Intel SDO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/secure-device-onboard) (Secure Device Onboard) can be added to an Open Horizon instance by simply importing their associated ownership vouchers and then powering on the devices. The software in this git repository provides integration between SDO and Open Horizon, making it easy to use SDO-enabled edge devices with Horizon.

The following versions of SDO have been integrated with Horizon. Use the version that is the same as the `sdo-owner-service` container running on your Horizon management hub.
