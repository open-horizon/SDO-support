# the horizon agent and log all of its stdout/stderr. SDO is slow at downloading this wrapper script to the device, so keep it as short as possible.
# This wrapper script is run on the edge device in the SDO directory /var/sdo/sdo_device_binaries_<version>_linux_x64/device. All of the needed files
# like agent-install.cfg and agent-install.crt are downloaded by SDO to the same directory.
